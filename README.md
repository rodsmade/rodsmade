### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Call me Rods. Everything here is made by me :-)

Following a career change in 2019 and subsequent professional experience at the financial sector, I decided to go back and take my time learning the basics of at 42 School SÃ£o Paulo - a disruptive school established around studentsâ€™ autonomy and peer-to-peer learning - which I'm enjoying thoroughly!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and C++
- :hammer: I have work experience with a range of technologies, frameworks and systems, including Java/Spring Boot, Python/Flask, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript/React, Cobol/IMS, Relational and NoSQL databases and AWS.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - My [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-gregoldo)
  - Read about my trajectory at 42 School on [Medium](https://medium.com/@rodsmade) (:brazil: in Portuguese)
  - Take a peek at my self-made syllabus for every 42 School project I've done so far over at [Notion](https://rodsmade.notion.site/rodsmade/Acelera-42cursus-400c86d2e61242338b010c23c6930134) (:brazil: in Portuguese)

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 42! I'm passionate about it :)

- âš¡ Fun facts:
  - I have an engineering degree while also having learned a fair bit of visual design, to the extent that I have freelanced in the field.
  - I've done freelance translations (pt <-> en) and even translated subtitles to a Netflix show!
  - I have always enjoyed mathematics and logic, while also being passionate about the arts (particuarly visuals and music).
