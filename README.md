### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Call me Rods. Everything here is made by me :-)

Following a career change in 2019 and subsequent professional experience with software development in the financial sector, I decided to go back and take my time learning the basics of at 42 School SÃ£o Paulo - a disruptive school established around studentsâ€™ autonomy and peer-to-peer learning - which I'm enjoying thoroughly!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- :hammer: I have work experience with a range of technologies, frameworks and systems, including Java/Spring Boot, Python/Flask, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript/React, Cobol/IMS, Relational/NoSQL databases, and AWS.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - My [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-gregoldo)
  - Read about my trajectory at 42 School on [Medium](https://medium.com/@rodsmade) (:brazil: in Portuguese)
  - Peek at what I've been learning at 42 School project over at [my main reppository](https://github.com/rodsmade/Projets_42_SP/blob/main/README_en.md) or at [Notion](https://rodsmade.notion.site/rodsmade/Acelera-42cursus-400c86d2e61242338b010c23c6930134) (:brazil: in Portuguese)
